# ðŸ’¹ FinChatX â€” Conversational Finance Analyst (LangChain + MCP + Groq)

> **FinChatX** is an **agentic finance assistant** powered by **LangChain**, **Groq API**, **FastMCP**, and **Streamlit**.  
> It acts as an intelligent analyst capable of fetching live stock data, market movers, and financial news â€”  
> combining **MCP tool orchestration**, **asynchronous workflows**, and a **LangGraph-inspired architecture**.

---

##  Overview

**FinChatX** simulates an **autonomous financial analyst** system integrating modern AI and multi-agent design principles.  
It demonstrates how to combine *LLM reasoning*, *tool calling*, and *async MCP workflows* for real-world financial data retrieval.

-  **LangChain AgentExecutor** for reasoning and decision-making  
-  **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** for dynamic tool routing  
-  **Groq LLMs** (Llama 3.1/3.3) for ultra-fast inference  
-  **Streamlit UI** for user interaction and visualization  
-  **Asynchronous backend** for concurrent execution of tools

##  System Architecture

User Query â†’ Streamlit UI
â†“
LangChain AgentExecutor (Groq model)
â†“
Response â†’ Streamlit display + contextual follow-up suggestions


**Workflow Summary:**
1. User enters a question or ticker in Streamlit UI.  
2. The LangChain agent calls the **Groq LLM (via API)** for reasoning.  
3. If needed, the agent invokes an **MCP tool** (like `get_price`) through FastMCP.  
4. Tool results are processed and displayed interactively with suggestions.

##  APIs & External Services

FinChatX integrates multiple APIs and cloud endpoints to enable real-time financial insights and intelligent reasoning:

| **Service** | **Type** | **Usage in Project** | **Notes** |
|--------------|-----------|----------------------|------------|
| **Groq Cloud API** |  LLM Inference | Powers the LangChain agent using **Llama 3.1 8B Instant** for reasoning, summarization, and conversational logic. | Selected for its extremely low latency and production-ready performance. |
| **Finnhub API** |  Financial Data | Provides live stock quotes, market movers, and company metadata through secure API calls. | Used during the MCP tool development for real-time market data retrieval. |
| **yfinance** |  Data Fetching Library | Retrieves historical OHLCV data and complements Finnhub results when rate limits apply. | Lightweight, open-source fallback ensuring consistent availability. |
